    <h2>Welcome to the xEdit GitHub Page.</h2>
    <p>xEdit is an advanced graphical module editor and conflict detector for Bethesda games. It currently supports Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Skyrim SE.  We refer to the program as xEdit for short.</p>
    <p>When started xEdit will automatically find the Data directory. You then have a dialog box to select which masters/plugins you want to load with the current selection from your plugins.txt as default value.</p>
    <h2>What's new in xEdit 4.0.0?</h2>
    <a href="whatsnew.html">What's New</a>
    <p>Elminster has made significant changes between 3.2.2 and 4.0. Those changes are described in What's New and a document in rich text format is included with xEdit for offline viewing.</p>
    <h2>Become a Patreon:</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ElminsterAU">ElminsterAU's Patreon Page</a></p>
    <p>ElminsterAU has created a Patreon Page to outline his future xEdit development goals.</p>
    <h2>fopdoc</h2>
    <p>The above button labeled fopdoc connects to the Fallout record definitions. It has complete definitions for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. Unfortunately Fallout 4 information is not finished yet. The fopdoc site was started and is maintained by Ortham.</p>
