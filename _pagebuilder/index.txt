xEdit is an advanced graphical module editor and conflict detector for Bethesda games. It currently supports Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Skyrim SE.  We refer to the program as xEdit for short.

When started xEdit will automatically find the Data directory. You then have a dialog box to select which masters/plugins you want to load with the current selection from your plugins.txt as default value.
